# scenario: A facial recognition system misidentifies minorities at higher rates

## Ethical Risks
1. Wrongful Arrests and Discrimination

- Facial recognition systems have shown higher error rates for people of color, women, and young individuals due to biased training data.

- Misidentification can lead to wrongful arrests, detainment, and even criminal records for innocent individuals, reinforcing systemic bias in law enforcement.

2. Violation of Privacy

- Constant surveillance without consent undermines individual privacy rights, especially in public spaces.

- The use of facial recognition by police could create a chilling effect, where people avoid public events or protests out of fear of being tracked.

3. Lack of Transparency and Accountability

- There is no public knowledge of how facial recognition decisions are made or how errors are corrected.

- Individuals wrongly identified may struggle to appeal or seek justice due to lack of access or oversight.

4. Erosion of Public Trust

- When communities see technologies disproportionately used against them, it damages the trust between citizens and law enforcement.


## Recommended Policies for Responsible Deployment
1. Bias Audits and Diverse Training Data

- Require third-party bias audits before deployment.

- Mandate the use of diverse, representative training datasets to reduce algorithmic bias.

2. Strict Use Limitations

- Restrict facial recognition use to serious criminal investigations and prohibit real-time mass surveillance.

- Require judicial oversight (e.g. warrants) before use.

3. Transparency and Public Involvement

- Law enforcement agencies must disclose where and how facial recognition is being used.

- Allow for public comment and input before deploying the technology in communities.

4. Human Oversight

- Ensure all facial recognition matches are reviewed and verified by trained officers before any action is taken.

- Facial recognition should be treated as an investigative lead, not definitive evidence.

5. Right to Appeal and Redress

- Establish clear processes for appealing misidentifications and seeking compensation or correction.

- Maintain a log of all uses and misidentifications for review and improvement.

6. Periodic Auditing and Impact Assessments

- Conduct regular algorithm performance reviews and social impact assessments.

- Suspend or revoke use if bias or misuse is detected.
