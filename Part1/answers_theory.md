# AI Ethics Assignment â€“ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

**Algorithmic bias** refers to systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that lead to unfair outcomes, often privileging one group over another due to flaws in data, design, or assumptions.

### Examples:
1. **Credit Scoring Systems**: AI models trained on historical financial data may favor applicants from affluent ZIP codes, leading to discriminatory loan approvals against minority groups.
2. **Healthcare Diagnostics**: AI trained primarily on male patient data may under-diagnose or misdiagnose women, due to gender imbalance in training data.

## Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

- **Transparency** means openness about the design, data sources, algorithms, and decision-making processes of an AI system.
- **Explainability** refers to the extent to which a human can understand the reasoning behind an AI decision or prediction.

### Importance:
- **Transparency** builds trust and allows stakeholders to audit systems.
- **Explainability** ensures users can interpret and contest AI outputs, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, or criminal justice.

## Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?

GDPR enforces strict data governance rules that affect AI development:

- Requires **explicit user consent** for data collection and usage.
- Grants users the **right to explanation** (Article 22) of automated decisions, promoting human oversight.
- Encourages **ethical-by-design** systems through principles like **data minimization**, **privacy by default**, and **accountability**.
